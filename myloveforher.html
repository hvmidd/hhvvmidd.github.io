           <h5>❤ My Love For You ❤</h5> 
           <p>There's so much that i can write about this, i can never truly express the genuine size and depth of my love for you, no wonder or vocabulary can ever come close to
            perfectly expressing the amount of pure love i have for you. I have ever only fallen in love once in my life, and its you ania, i used to always think i experienced being in love
            in my past, but when i met you and i fell for you, that all changed. You gave my soul the privilege to be able to experience one of the gifts of life, being love.
           </p>
           <p>You've given me the chance to experience being in love, feeling love, acting on love and all the emotional roller coasters that love brings itself with, and i'll always
            be lucky to be able to have my soul experience something as beautiful as love with someone as beautiful as you, i love you so much, to the moon and back, till death does us apart,
            in this life, and in the hereafter Insha'Allah. The purest form of love i've felt and i've have towards has only been one person in my lifetime, and its you, and always will be
            you.
           </p>
           <p>You're the woman thats going to complete me, thats going to complete half of my deen. The woman thats going to be the beautiful mother to my kids, You're the person who has
            showed me how to grow, how to maintain my emotions within myself and not let it explode, you're the person who has made me strive to be better, given me motivation to push harder,
            you're the person who makes my life better, removes the negative and exchanges it with the positive.
           </p>
           <p>You give my life meaning, beauty, color, adventure, pleasure, satisfaction. No matter how hard the road is with us, i'll take it, its going to be hard, yes, but, im willing to
            go through it for you, willing to fight through it for you, to sacrifice for you, i love you so much angel, i'll love you the way you deserve to be loved, and i'll give you the 
            happiest life princess.
           </p>
