           <h5>❤ Your Eyes ❤</h5> 
           <p>Where can i even start with this,  its the most beautiful thing i laid eyes on the first time i saw you in real life
            because trust me, its one thing to see them in pictures, but God is it some other thing to see them in real life, i get lost in them, the mixture of vibrant colors
            that form your eyes is so mesmerizing and out of this world, its so celestial, I hope every single one of our children take your eyes, just like they're
            angelic mother.
           </p>
           <h5>❤ Your Lips ❤</h5>
           <p>The shade of colors your lips have is so pretty, i love your lips, and you have noticed too, you have caught me looking at them in real life at times, you have such
            nice lips, it makes me want to kiss you everytime i see you, i can't wait to see you again, to be able to hold you by your waist gently, and kiss them. Their shape, colors
            and size makes it all perfect, everything about you is so loveable.
           </p>
           <h5>❤ Your Freckles ❤</h5>
           <p>This is something i noticed about you from the very beginning, i dont know if i have told you this before, but i really have a soft spot for freckles, its one of the things
            that really caught my attention of you when we first started talking, they're so adorable on you, as they say, you truly do look like you were kissed by an angel.
           </p>
           <h5>❤ Your Nose ❤</h5>
           <p>Your nose is so cute, they're so adorable. I never understood why you disliked them, when i first showed my mom a picture of you for the first time
            the first thing she noticed is your nose, she called it adorable, and that speaks alot my love.
           </p>
