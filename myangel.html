           <h5>❤ My Pretty Angel ❤</h5> 
           <p>My pretty angel is my favorite thing in choosing what to call you, i've said this alot before, and i think you've noticed it too, but my favorite word to describe your looks, 
            you as a whole, your personality, your existence, and your overall aura is the word angelic. You're the perfect description of the word angelic, and the word angel in itself, in my
            eyes you glow so bright, you're so clean, your goddamn eyes, everything about you has the characteristic of an angel, my pretty angel literally.
           </p>
           <p>You're so pure my love, everything that i have been talking about in these slides that are apart of this website that i have made for you, goes into details to why i view as 
            my angel, you're so beautiful, you're so caring and considerate, you're so understanding, you're thoughtful, and your existence genuinely brings such a positive change to my life, 
            you make me feel safe, make me feel happy and secure within myself and within us as well. You bring with yourself this feeling of security that i never have felt, or even thought i could
            feel from another person, its why you're my angel, my form of security and love, i love you.
           </p>
           <p>I always tell you this my love, you heal my kidself inside of me so well and so nicely, he feels so safe, he heals from all his trauma and difficulties that life threw towards
            his way, if you were to be infront of my kidself righ tnow, he would sprint towards you without a doubt or a second thought, cause you'd be the most secure, loving, peaceful and 
            soothing place he could be, he would hug you so tightly, and fall asleep withing your arms so nicely and peacefully.
           </p>
