           <p>I want to talk about my promise to you, i know in your past, you have had bad experiences with love, with relationships and with the promises that people have given you, but i will
            make sure to change all that, i promise you that i'll truly show you what healthy love is like, i'll never leave you, or lose interest, i'll always shower you with love, and show you
            the amount of worth you hold in my eyes. I will always take care of you, provide for you, look after you. I will always make you tiktoks, write you paragraphs and love letters for you

            you will experience true love, and healthy love, ill make sure of this baby, you will always have someone that loves you with all their heart, someone who is immensely proud of you as long as
            i am alive.
           </p>
           <p>These are the promises that i have made for you, and i will do everything in my power to prove to you that these promises are not just words, but actions that will play out to make you
            happy, loved, taken care of and safe. I want to end this page by something i've been building my courage to tell you, i cant continue another day without being truly yours, so can i
